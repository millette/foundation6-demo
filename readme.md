# ZURB Template
[![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/badges/github.com/millette/foundation6-demo.svg)](https://gemnasium.com/github.com/millette/foundation6-demo)

This is a fork of the official ZURB Template for use with [Foundation for Sites](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites). We use this template at ZURB to deliver static code to our clients. It has a Gulp-powered build system with these features:

- Handlebars HTML templates with Panini
- Sass compilation and prefixing
- JavaScript concatenation
- Built-in BrowserSync server
- For production builds:
  - CSS compression
  - JavaScript compression
  - Image compression

## Installation

To use this template, your computer needs:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (0.12 or greater)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

This template can be installed with the Foundation CLI, or downloaded and set up manually.

### Using the CLI

Install the Foundation CLI with this command:

```bash
npm install foundation-cli --global
```

Use this command to set up a blank Foundation for Sites project with this template:

```bash
foundation new --framework sites --template zurb
```

The CLI will prompt you to give your project a name. The template will be downloaded into a folder with this name.

### Manual Setup

To manually set up the template, first download it with Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zurb/foundation-zurb-template projectname
```

Then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd projectname
npm install
bower install
```

Finally, run `npm start` to run Gulp. Your finished site will be created in a folder called `dist`, viewable at this URL:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

For some reason, running gulp direction won't work, but this will:

```bash
foundation watch
```


To create compressed, production-ready assets, run `npm run build`.
